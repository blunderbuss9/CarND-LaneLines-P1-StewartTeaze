# CarND-LaneLines-P1-StewartTeaze
Stewart Teaze's GitHub repository for Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Term1 Project1

### List of Files in the Repository
P1.ipynb - The executable Python Notebook file containing the project code
README.md - This file
writeup.md - Detailed explanation of the project implementation
test_images - Six required test input images
test_images_output - Six required test output images, with lane lines overlayed
test_videos - Two required test input videos
test_videos_output - Two required test output videos, with lane lines overlayed

### Execution Instructions
The Lane Lines project program can be executed by opening the P1.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)
file, in the repository, and executing each code cell in the Jupyter Notebook, in sequence.
This will result in:
 1) All of the required test input images will be read in, and the required
    test output images (with lane lines overlayed) will be output to the required output directory.
 2) Each of the two required test input videos will be utilized to generate test output videos in the
    required output directory, and these test output videos can be viewed from within the Jupyter Notebook
    by executing the appropriate code cells.
(See file writeup.md, for more information)
